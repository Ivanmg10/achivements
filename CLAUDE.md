# CLAUDE.md — Achievements Tracker

## Project
Multi-user RetroAchievements companion. Public tracker with groups,
stats, and personalization. Next.js 14 App Router + PostgreSQL + Tailwind v4.

## Stack
- Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- Auth: NextAuth.js
- DB: PostgreSQL via `pg` pool
- Styles: Tailwind CSS v4
- Animations: Framer Motion
- Data: RetroAchievements API

## Code structure

### Folder / naming
- Component: `kebab-case/PascalCase.tsx`
  e.g. `main-side-panel/MainSidePanel.tsx`
- Sub-component: `parent-name-sub-name/ParentNameSubName.tsx`
- Hooks: `src/hooks/useXxx.ts` — never inline in component
- Pure transforms: `src/utils/utils.tsx` (NOT apiCallsUtils)

### File internal order
1. `'use client'` (if needed)
2. External imports (react, next, next-auth)
3. Internal: types → hooks → utils → components
4. Constants (ALL_CAPS)
5. Inline helpers (only if <15 lines + presentational + single use)
6. Default export component
7. Inside component: state → refs → hooks → useEffect → derived → handlers → return

### Custom hooks
- All hooks in `src/hooks/`
- Hooks own: session check, hasFetched guard, fetch, state
- `hasFetched = useRef(false)` pattern lives in hook, not component

### Sub-component extraction — MANDATORY
**Goal: pages and components as independent and self-contained as possible.**

Extract to its own file+folder when:
- Used in 2+ places, OR
- Has complex or independent meaning (card, grid, list, section, modal content), OR
- Adds meaningful visual/logical separation to the parent

Keep inline ONLY if: <15 lines + purely presentational + single file.

**Any JSX block added in a session that qualifies MUST be extracted before the task is considered done.**
When in doubt, extract. Prefer more files over bloated components.

## API calls — error handling MANDATORY
Every API call added or modified must have its own error handling. No exceptions.

- `fetch` calls: check `response.ok`, handle non-2xx explicitly
- Catch network/unexpected errors with `try/catch`
- Set appropriate error state so the UI can reflect failure (error message, empty state, retry)
- Do not let errors propagate silently or swallow them with empty catch blocks
- API route handlers (`route.ts`): always return structured error responses with correct HTTP status codes

## Testing — MANDATORY
Every new feature, hook, or utility must include tests. Tests live alongside the code they cover.

- Hooks: test with `renderHook` from `@testing-library/react`
- Components: test with `@testing-library/react` — cover render, interactions, edge cases
- Utils: plain unit tests (input → output)
- API routes: test happy path + error cases
- Run `npm test` before marking any task done
- Do not leave untested code — if it's complex enough to extract, it's complex enough to test

## Non-negotiable standards (apply to ALL work)

### 1. Responsive
Mobile-first. Tailwind sm/md/lg prefixes. No fixed widths that break mobile.

### 2. Accessible (WCAG 2.1)
- Interactive = `<button>` or `<a>`, never `<div onClick>`
- Icon-only buttons → `aria-label`
- Decorative icons → `aria-hidden="true"`
- Inputs → `<label htmlFor>` + `id`
- Toggles → `role="switch"` + `aria-checked`
- Errors → `role="alert"`, success → `role="status"`
- Selected states must not rely on color alone

### 3. i18n
- All user-facing strings via `T.*` from `useLanguage()` hook
- New strings → add to both `src/translations/en.ts` and `src/translations/es.ts`
- Admin panel exempt

## Versioning

Single source of truth: `src/lib/version.ts` → `APP_VERSION`.

**Scheme (semver):**
- `x.0.0` — major: huge integrations or platform shifts (e.g. Steam)
- `0.x.0` — minor: new pages, sections, significant feature changes
- `0.0.x` — patch: small fixes, optimizations, tweaks

**Pre-release suffixes** (optional, for WIP features):
- `0.9.0-beta` — feature in progress
- `0.9.0-rc.1` — release candidate, near-final

**Auto-bump via git hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`):**
- Every commit auto-bumps patch (`0.8.0` → `0.8.1`)
- To do a minor/major bump: edit `src/lib/version.ts` manually before committing — hook detects the change, skips auto-bump, and syncs `package.json`
- Hook is activated via `npm run prepare` (already wired in `package.json`)

**Current milestone targets:**
- `0.8.x` — current: login/register polish + optimizations
- `0.9.0` — stats page reorganization
- `1.0.0` — Steam integration

## Git — commits
Claude can commit when asked. **Never add `Co-Authored-By: Claude` lines** — all commits must appear solely under the user's name so GitHub contributions are attributed correctly.

## Style
- Single quotes, no trailing semicolons
- Spanish UI text is intentional — do not change it

## Roadmap (pending)
- [ ] Steam integration
- [ ] Public user profiles
- [ ] Group hardcore achievement tracking
- [ ] Push notifications
- [ ] 13 optimization fixes (cache stampede, Cache-Control headers, duplicate fetches, TTLs, error boundaries, lazy images)
